# TaxiBookingApplication
# I built a neat taxi booking system using Java. The project is organized with a Main class that runs the show, a Taxi class to represent each available car, and a Booking class to keep track of all the ride requests.
# To manage lists, like the taxis that are free or the bookings that are waiting, I used ArrayLists.
# It's a clear and practical way to handle the information, allowing the system to add new taxis or bookings and find what it needs. 
# The program basically lets you simulate booking a taxi, showing how these different parts work together to make it happen.
